		<h1>My Future</h1>
		
		<h2>High School</h2>
			<p>There are many high schools that are offered by the Long Beach Unified School District. My top 3 choices were CAMS, Mcbride, and Lakewood. I chose CAMS, California Academy of Mathmatics and Science, as my first choice because their focus there was only Mathmatics and Science for they rank you and chose the applicant by their Math and Science grades. I believe that this would be a good school for me because it is a like the ATM program but more advanced. CAMS teaches you about some of many of the things you would need to know in jobs like engineering, Software Designing, and computer graphics. My second choice was Ernest S. McBride, Sr. High School because of its engineering program. I chose McBride as my second choice instead of my first because its main focus wasn't on engineering and to my sister's experience there, some of the teachers were hard to work with. My third choice was Lakewood High School because it was my home school. According to the Long Beach Unified School district, if you do not put your home school as on of your choices then your priority there is going to be given to another student. </p>

		<h2>College</h2>
			<p>Out of all the colleges in California, the college I would like to go to is Stanford University. This is because I really enjoyed walking and learning about their programs when my family and I went to San Fransico to visit the college tours there. The program that I am really interested in there is their Computer Science program because some of major technology influences went there. For an example, the creators of Google.</p>

		<h2>Career Interests</h2>
			<p>Some of my Career Interests are an engineer and Software designer. I want to become an engineer because I want to learn more about technology and now to build, or create, it. I have always wanted to learn how to create a computer just from scratch. I would also like to become a Software designer because I want to able to learn more about code so that I can create programs that are really helpful to the world. I think that wanting to learn more about the coding languages and how all of them are connected really influenced me to have those career interests. If I did not experience coding in 6th grade, I probably would still have the dream of being an artist or graphic designer. </p>

		<h2>Goals</h2>
			<p>To be completely honest, I don't have many goals in life. One of them is to finish all of my education so that I can pursue the dreams I have in the future without holding me back. Another goal that I have is to acquire the job that I want, not what others want for me. I don't want to have a job that I have to do just so that I can survive in this world. I don't want to go home with hatred for my job everyday. I want to go home happy and satisfied with what I have accomplished that day at work. My final goal, before I die, would probably be to travel the world to see what I am missing out in every culture. But I would only do this if it was by myself and not with others so that I can get the full experience that I wanted not what others wanted. </p>

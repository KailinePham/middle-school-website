		<h2>My opinion</h2>
			<p>ATM is a very interesting program to be in. It introduced many things to students about computers that you did not even think you could do. I would say that my 7th and 8th grade years were definitely the most fun I had in this program. This was only because I always wanted to learn how to code and use photoshop & illustrator. If you really like using computers and want to accel your skills in technology, then I would definitely recommend this program. ATM really covers almost a little bit of everything so that you get a head start on some programs. This is so that you can figure out if you want to improve in the software; or have knowledge on a software, so that you will not struggle with it in the future.</p>

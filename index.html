		<h2>Skills</h2>
			<p>I have many computer skills but not all. I think that the most important computer skills are being able to use any or all Microsoft programs and being able to read and type HTML & CSS. I think that these skills are important because one, most jobs are going to be using Microsoft softwares, and two, as time and technology progresses, I believe that coding will get more and more important to where it is being taught in schools all over the world.</p>
			<p>I know how to use Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, and Excel. I also know how to use Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Photoshop is a photoediting software, while Illustrator is a graphic design program. I can also use different kinds of softwares. Here's some of them: Windows 2000, 7, 8, 10, and OSX. OSX is the software on an Apple computer. Another important skill that I have is coding. I can be read and type some of the HTML & CSS language. </p>

		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
			<p>I have many hobbies but I'm only going to be talking about the main ones. Some of the main hobbies that I have are creating origami, playing video games, and reading manga.</p>
			<h3>Origami</h3>
				<p><img class="left" src="images/origami.jpg" alt="two 3D origami stars">Origami is a where you create a figure only using folds. You cannot use glue, tape, or anything that helps the paper hold together. Origami varies in many ways. You can create 3D origami where you create the same piece over and over again, then take those pieces and put it together like a puzzle. You can also create the traditional origami where you only use one piece of paper that is usually square shaped. I really like origami because you can never run out of ideas of what to create. Another reason why I like origami is because it helped me be more precise on folding and cutting, but I would say overall that its just the creative aspect that I like about it. That is just because it makes it really challenging.</p>
				
			<h3>Video games</h3>
				<p>I have played a varity of video games so far. Some of the games I played were RPGs, MMORPG, hack & slash, and FPS games. RPGs and MMORPGs are games like Elsword and Maple Story, while Hack & Slash games are games like RWBY: Grim Eclipse. FPS games are first person shooter games. For an example, the Call of Duty series and Counter Strike series.</p>

		<h2>Interests</h2>
			<p><img class="right" src="images/highjump.jpg" alt="woman high jumping">Some of the interests I have are in Track and Field and Coding. I am interested in Track and Field because I love the community in that sport and the thrill of jumping over the high jump bar. I also love the feeling of a successful pass during relays. They also have a really great community full of different personalities. I also like how everyone in the community helps everyone out especially during the competition to help them with their skills in the event the athlete is competing in. I am interested in coding because I want to become a software designer when I grow up. Also because I am fasinated that there are many different languages of coding. I want to be able to read, understand, and type many other languages of coding.</p>
